We are not able to process this invoice, because credit memo lines must be submitted via the original invoice or entered as a discount to the line item. If the credit is for a discount to the current invoice you will enter a discount to the line item not to exceed or equal the amount of the line item. Discounts may be split between more than one line if necessary. If the credit line is due to a change in a previous invoice entry please submit a credit memo by locating the original invoice in your Ariba outbox or email, then selecting the credit memo button to enter the information. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact DevonDirect@dvn.com. OR view the video tutorials at http://www.devonenergy.com/operations/supply-chain/information.
